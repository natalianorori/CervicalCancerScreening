# Barriers to cervical cancer screening among immigrant women affected by conflict and crisis 

## Background:  
Cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of death among Latin American women. Adherence with screening recommendations can increase chances of survival but disparities in Pap test compliance exist, and may be due to perceived barriers or lack of knowledge. The adherence rates and factors that influence cervical cancer screening among immigrant women living in Costa Rica have not been documented. Since the beginning of the Nicaraguan socio political crisis in 2018, more than 55,000 Nicaraguans have migrated to Costa Rica, and around 55% of them are women. Most of the immigrants maintain an illegal status in the country, are uninsured. 

The direct consequences of political conflict and war often overshadow its effect on public health. Refugee women displaced by conflict are particularly vulnerable, as they face many barriers in accessing reproductive health services, and are at higher risk of suffering from sexually transmitted diseases, including HPV.  

Migrants and refugees are not only vulnerable to sexually transmitted diseases during transit, but also after they have reached their final destination. Once they reach their destination, refugee women continue to lack access to contraceptive methods, infectious disease screening, and medical support. Cultural and economic barriers, experiences of stigma and discrimination, and fear of being deported are some of the reasons refugee women are often hesitant to seek healthcare services. Lack of awareness about their rights and cultural barriers are also key obstacles that need to be addressed to develop effective service delivery plans. 


## Objective: 
To explore Pap test utilization and perceived barriers to cervical cancer screening attendance among immigrants and refugee women displaced by conflict. 

## Methods: 
Qualitative study. In-depth interviews were conducted among Nicaraguan immigrant women. The data collection instrument included questions on demographic characteristics, health insurance, health literacy, knowledge, attitudes and beliefs towards cervical cancer screening and barriers to screening.


## Results: 
The study has indicated a need for education on the necessity of screening among immigrant and refugee women. It has the potential to provide qualitative information on utilization patterns of cervical cancer screening. So far, weâ€™ve encountered that lack of knowledge, fear of Pap smears, economic conditions, and fear of being deported when accessing health services.

We call health care providers and policy makers to engage in efforts to address the need of awareness and better screening practices among women who recently immigrated in low and middle income countries. 

We will be updating and translating our results to english once they are final. 


## Conclusion:
Efforts to improve coverage need to emphasize women who recently immigrated and those with socioeconomic disadvantage.Culturally relevant screening strategies and programs that address these sociocultural factors must be developed to address the growing disparity in cervical cancer burden among underserved. 

The fear of discrimination and previous xenofobic experiences prevent women of identifying themselves as immigrant or refugees, the current nicaraguan socio political crisis and lack of support from the Nicaraguan authorities prevents Nicaraguan women from getting support from their home nation, low socio-economic status prevents them from screening and inadequate living conditions are key factors to take into consideration when coming up with solutions to the problem. 

To put into practice innovative solutions, it is essential to create safe spaces and culturally relevant campaigns that take into account various factors that influence health care utilization among immigrants and Nicaraguan refugees living in Costa Rica. Addressing health literacy and knowledge gaps among this population through personal approaches and educational campaigns that involve the participation of multi-stakeholders may be useful to increase Cervical cancer screening awareness and reduce the incidence of invasive cancer among immigrant and refugee women in socio economic disadvantage.
